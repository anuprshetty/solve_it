# Design Patterns

Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Classification of patterns

- Creational patterns: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns: concerned with algorithms, and take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
