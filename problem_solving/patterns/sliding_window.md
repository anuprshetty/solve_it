# Sliding Window

- The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of k elements.
- Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.
- Pattern execution flow:
  - setup: consider the first window of k elements.
  - flow: then slide the window.
  - teardown: reaches the last window.
- Ex: Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.
