# Greedy Method

## Notes

- Optimization problem is a problem that demand either minimum result or maximum result.
- Greedy method is used for solving optimization problems.
- Possible Solutions --> Feasible Solutions --> Optimal Solution.
- Greedy method says that a problem should be solved in stages. In each stage, we consider one input from a given problem and if that input is feasible then we include it in the solution. So by including all those feasible inputs, we will get the optimal solution.

## Difference between greedy method and dynamic programming

- In greedy method, the decision is taken one time and we follow that procedure.
- In dynamic programming, the decision is taken at every stage.
