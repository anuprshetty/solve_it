# Prefix Sum

- Prefix Sum involves preprocessing an array to create a new array where each element at index i represents the sum of the array from the start up to i. This allows for efficient sum queries on subarrays.
- Use this pattern when you need to perform multiple sum queries on a subarray or need to calculate cumulative sums.
- Pattern execution flow:
  - setup: <!-- todo: -->
  - flow: <!-- todo: -->
  - teardown: <!-- todo: -->
- Ex: answer multiple queries about the sum of elements within a specific range [i, j] of an array.
