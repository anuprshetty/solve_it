# HCF/GCD and LCM

## HCF (Highest Common Factor) or GCD(Greatest Common Divisor)

- The HCF or GCD of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder (Largest number dividing all inputs).

## LCM (Least Common Multiple)

- The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers(Smallest number divisible by all inputs).

## Formula: HCF(a,b) \* LCM(a,b) = a \* b

- Example:  
  Let a=12 and b=15:  
  a = 2^2 \* 3^1  
  b = 3^1 \* 5^1  
  HCF = 3^1 = 3  
  LCM = 2^2 \* 3^1 \* 5^1 = 60  
  a \* b = 180  
  HCF \* LCM = 180
