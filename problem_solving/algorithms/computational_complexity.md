## P (deterministic polynomial time) problems

- Problems that can be solved by an algorithm in polynomial time (efficiently).

## NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problems

- Problems for which it's not necessarily easy to find a solution, but if someone gives you a solution, you can verify it in polynomial time.

## Info

- These are research topics
- Polynomial time taking algorithms and exponential time taking algorithms.
