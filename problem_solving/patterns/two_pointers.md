# Two Pointers

- The Two Pointers pattern involves using two pointers to iterate through an array or list, often used to find pairs or elements that meet specific criteria.
- Use this pattern when dealing with sorted arrays or lists where you need to find pairs that satisfy a specific condition.
- Pattern execution flow:
  - setup: two pointers start at each end of the array.
  - flow: then based on the conditions, they come close to each other.
  - teardown: the two pointers meet at some point.
- Ex:
  - Check whether a string is a palindrome or not.
  - Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target value.
