# Dynamic Programming

## Notes

- Optimization problem is a problem that demand either minimum result or maximum result.
- Dynamic programming is used for solving optimization problems.
- Possible Solutions --> Feasible Solutions --> Optimal Solution.
- Principle of optimality says that a problem can be solved by taking sequence of decisions to get the optimal solution.
- Dynamic programming follows principle of optimality.
- Dynamic programming means tabular values. i.e., dynamically generated table.

## Difference between greedy method and dynamic programming

- In greedy method, the decision is taken one time and we follow that procedure.
- In dynamic programming, the decision is taken at every stage.

## Memorization vs tabulation in dynamic programming

- Memorization follows top-down approach (by recursion).
- Tabulation follows bottom-up approach (by iteration).
- Generally tabulation is preferred instead of memorization in dynamic programming.
